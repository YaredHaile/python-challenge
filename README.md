# python-challenge

Background
In this assignment, students are expected to use the concepts they've learned to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks present a real-world situation where their newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy.

Challenge - One

Students are tasked with creating a Python script to analyse the financial records of a company, using a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

The task is to create a Python script that analyses the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Challenge - Two

Students are tasked with helping a small, rural U.S. town modernise its vote-counting process.

The students will be provided with a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
